# Brandeis University COSI 12B, Spring 2016 PA10

Due date: April 11th, 2016 at 10am and April 18th, 2016 at 10am (see below)

## Overview
This assignment will teach you about the basics of compiling and interpreting computer programs. We expect this to be a very difficult assignment. Please note that the final part of the assignment -- the compiler -- is only worth 15% of the grade. Overall, this PA **does not* count more than any of the other PAs. For many students, studying compilers and interpreters brings about an "ah-ha!" moment that clarifies much about computer science in general.

Turn in an Eclipse export of your working code. The assignment involves designing a series of classes and the interactions between them.

### Learning Objectives

  * Students will practice creating custom `Iterator`s
  * Students will practice using tree data structures

  * Students will practice traversing and evaluating trees recursively
  * Students will learn about low-level instructions that make up modern computers and how higher-level programming langauges can be transformed into these low-level instructions.
  * Students will think abstractly about the nature of computer programming languages
  * Students will write a basic lexer and parser

## Background information



### PitoScript

In this assignment, you'll be implementing a small calculator language called PitoScript. Here's an example of a PitoScript program that prompts the user for two values and computes the sum of their squares.

```
a = ?;
b = ?;
c = (a^2) + (b^2);
```

Each line consists of a variable name (i.e. `a`, `b`, `c`), an equal sign, and then a parenthetical arithmetic expression. The special character `?` means that the user will be prompted for input. Here's what this PitoScript program will look like when it is ran:


>Input? 3  
>Input? 4  
>{a = 3, b = 4, c = 25}  

The output of the program (third line) is a map showing which variables have which values. Here, the `3` and the `4` were inputted by the user.

### Compilation and Interpretation

In this assignment, you'll be implementing PitoScript in two different ways:

1. **Interpreter**: you'll write a program that reads in a PitoScript program and outputs the value of each variable.
1. **Compilation**: you'll write a program that reads in PitoScript and outputs an equivalent program in a low-level assembly language.

You can think of an interpreter as an **evaluator** and a compiler as a **translator**. We'll discuss a few important general topics, and then we'll detail a few steps to go about implementing these.

### Formal Grammar

We often use *formal grammars* to describe programming languages. Here's the grammar for PitoScript, in [approximate-BNF form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form):

```
(0) program     → statement*
(1) statement   → variable '=' expr ';'
(2) expr        → '(' expr ')'
(3)             | expr operator expr
(4)             | variable
(5)  			| number
(6)             | '?'
(7) operator    → '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | '^'
(8) variable    → word
```


This probably doesn't immediately clarify what's going on. We'll decompose and explain each line of the grammar.

```
program     → statement*
```

This line says that a program is a sequence of zero or more statements. The `*` character is what signifies the "zero or more" part. Each line is called a *production rule* because it explains how to decompose the thing on the left-hand side into more primitive pieces. The first symbol given in a formal grammar is also called the *start symbol*.

```
statement   → variable '=' expr ';'
```

This line says that a statement is exactly one variable, followed by an equals sign, followed by an `expr` (an expression), followed by a semicolon (`;`).

```
expr        → '(' expr ')'
            | expr operator expr
            | variable
			| number
			| '?'
```

These lines say that an expression (`expr`) can be one of four things. The first line says that an expression can be a left parenthesis followed by an expression followed by a right parenthesis.

The second line says that an expression can also just be an expression followed by an operator followed by an expression. In other words, that parenthesis can be committed.

The third line says that a single variable can be an expression (in other words, the line `x = y;` is a valid statement). The final line says that an expression can just be a number, so that `x = 5;` is a valid statement.

The final line says that a question mark (prompt for user input) is a valid expression.

```
operator    → '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | '^'
```

This lines says that an operator is one of the 5 symbols listed above.


```
variable    → word
```

This line says that a variable is a `word`. We define a word as a non-empty sequence of alphabetical characters, i.e. "x" or "myVar". Only characters in `A-Z` and `a-z` may be inside of a word, so no spaces or numbers.



Finally, we say that a `number` is something that starts with a digit and contains only digits or a single decimal point. In other words, `10.0` is a number but `.3` is not. `10` is also a number, as is `10.5`. But `10.2.3` is not a number. By this definition, `10.` is also a number.

Each of the lines in the frammar is sometimes known as a production rule. To the left of the arrow there is a “symbol” (classified between terminal symbols and non-terminal symbols.) One of the Symbols is special and is known as the start symbol (here, `program`). Non-terminal symbols are defined in terms of other symbols. Terminal symbols correspond to actual text that appears in the program.


### Derivations and parsing

Once we have a formal grammar, we can use it to parse (although the technical term is *derive*, for reasons you will see in a moment) programs. Consider the following PitoScript program:

```
x = (50 + 6) * 2;
```

Using our production rules, we're now going to try and find a series of rule applications that will get us from `program` (the start symbol) to this string. We'll start with `program`, and then we'll replace the leftmost nonterminal value (values that appear on the left hand side of a production rule) by using a production rule. This produces what we call a *left derivation*:

```
program                                   // start symbol
statement                                 // rule 0
variable = expr ;                         // rule 1
x = expr ;                                // rule 8
x = expr operator expr ;                  // rule 3
x = (expr) operator expr;                 // rule 2
x = (expr operator expr) operator expr ;  // rule 3
x = (50 operator expr) operator expr;     // rule 5
x = (50 + expr) operator expr;            // rule 7
x = (50 + 6) operator expr;               // rule 5
x = (50 + 6) * expr;                      // rule 7
x = (50 + 6) * 2;                         // rule 5
```

This leads to a very natural representation of a derivation as a tree:


![Tree representation of derivation](http://cs.brandeis.edu/~rcmarcus/cs12b/derv1.png)
\

At the bottom of the tree, we have a sequence of *lexemes*, or the smallest lexical (letters) bits of the program. At the top of the tree, we have the start symbol `program` and a series of derivations that reach our lexemes. This tree is often referred to as a *syntactic parse tree*. 

Much more simply, think of each expression as either an operator over two other expressions, a number, or a variable. Further, think of each `statement` as assigning the value of an expression to a variable. Then, we can represent the above tree much more compactly:

![Parse tree](http://cs.brandeis.edu/~rcmarcus/cs12b/parse.png)
\

We often call this tree a *semantic parse tree*, or just a *parse tree*, as it compactly represents the computation that the user desires. Notice that the parenthesis were only used to give a hint about the structure of the tree, and were not actually included as nodes in the parse tree. Also note that this semantic parse tree represents only a single statement, and programs may have many statements.


### The Structure of an Interpreter and a Compiler 

When you are writing an interpreter for PitoScript, you'll follow this general process:

1. **Lexing**: transform the raw input string into a sequence of lexemes
2. **Parsing**: transform the sequence of lexemes into a parse tree, like the one above
3. **Evaluation**: recursively evaluate the parse tree and output an answer

For the final part of the assignment, wen you are writing a compiler for PitoScript, you'll follow this general process:

1. **Lexing**: same as before
2. **Parsing**: same as before
3. **Code generation**: recursively transform the parse tree into a sequence of low-level operations that will output the correct answer

So, the lexer and the parser are a shared component between both the interpreter and the compiler, but code generation and evaluation phases are entirely separate.


## Your task

In this assignment, your task is divided into four parts, which must be done in order:

1. *15%* Implement the `Lexer` class, which transforms a string into lexemes (**due April 11th, 10am**)
2. *35%* Implement the `Parser` class, which transforms a sequence of lexemes into a parse tree (**due April 11th, 10am**)
3. *35%* Implement the `Interpreter` class, which takes in a list of parse trees and figures out the final values of each variable (**due April 18th, 10am**)
4. *15%* Implement the `Compiler` class, which takes in a list of parse trees and outputs an equivalent program in a low-level language (**due April 18th, 10am**)



### Step 1: Implementing `Lexer` (due April 11th, 10am)

The `Lexer` class implements the `Iterator<Lexeme>` interface, which means it should provide a `hasNext` and `next` method. The purpose of the `Lexer` is to transform a raw input string into a sequence of lexemes.


Lexemes are represented by the `Lexeme` class, which has a type and a value. The types of lexemes are represented by the `LexemeType` enum. It's values are:

* `LEFT_PAREN`: represents a "("
* `RIGHT_PAREN`: represents a ")"
* `OPERATOR`: represents an operator, like `*`, `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^`
* `NUMBER`: represents a number
* `VARIABLE`: represents the name of a variable, like `x`
* `EQUALS`: represents an equals sign, `=`
* `SEMICOLON`: represents a semicolon, `;`
* `USER_INPUT`: represents the `?` sign, which, in PitoScript, means the user should be prompted for input.

The `Lexer` class, given a String through the constructor, produces a sequence of `Lexeme`s. The `next()` method should return an instance of the `Lexeme` class. For example, given the input string `x =   ( 1.2 + 2 ) * 6;`, the following sequence of lexemes should be produced:

```java
Lexer l = new Lexer("x =   ( 1.2 + 2 ) * 6;");
System.out.println(l.next()); // prints: [VARIABLE: x]
System.out.println(l.next()); // prints: [EQUALS: null]
System.out.println(l.next()); // prints: [LEFT_PAREN: null]
System.out.println(l.next()); // prints: [NUMBER: 1.2]
System.out.println(l.next()); // prints: [OPERATOR: +]
System.out.println(l.next()); // prints: [NUMBER: 2]
System.out.println(l.next()); // prints: [RIGHT_PAREN: null]
System.out.println(l.next()); // prints: [OPERATOR: *]
System.out.println(l.next()); // prints: [NUMBER: 6]
System.out.println(l.next()); // prints: [SEMICOLON: null]
System.out.println(l.hasNext()); // now prints: false
```

Notice that the value of a `Lexeme` can be null, and that the `Lexer` ignores whitespace.

You should implement your `Lexer` so that it produces each lexeme [lazily](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2155788/most-of-the-iterators-and-iterables-methods-are-lazy-what-does-this-mean), i.e. one-at-a-time. Each call to `next()` should cause your program to look ahead in the string and find the next value to return. You should not compute all the lexemes at once and then give them back one-by-one. **Solutions that are not properly lazy will receive a 10% penalty.**

After implementing the `Lexer` class, you should test your code with the `LexerTest` unit tests. It is important that you pass all these tests before proceeding to implement the parser, since the parser will require a correct sequence of lexemes.


### Step 2: Implementing `Parser` (due April 11th, 10am)

The `Parser` class is responsible for turning an `Iterator<Lexeme>` into a list of `ParseTreeNode`s. Each element in the list should represent one `statement`. The `ParseTreeNode` class has a few fields which  you can access through getters and setters (or the constructor):

* `ParseTreeNode.getLexeme()`, gets the `Lexeme` represented by this parse tree node.
* `ParseTreeNode.getLeft()`, gets the left child of the node.
* `ParseTreeNode.getRight()`, gets the right child of the node.


The `parse()` method should read from the `Iterator<Lexeme>` via the `next()` method and produce a list of `ParseTreeNode`s. Each of those `ParseTreeNode`s should have a structure similar to the parse tree in the background information section. For example, for this sequence of lexemes:

```
VARIABLE: x
EQUALS: null
LEFT_PAREN: null
NUMBER: 1.2
OPERATOR: +
NUMBER: 2
RIGHT_PAREN: null
OPERATOR: *
NUMBER: 6
SEMICOLON: null
```

... the `parse()` method should return a list with a single `ParseTreeNode`, and that `ParseTreeNode` should represent this tree:

![A parse tree of the above lexemes](http://cs.brandeis.edu/~rcmarcus/cs12b/parse2.png)
\ 

The root node -- depicted as an "=" -- is represented by a `ParseTreeNode` class with a `Lexeme` of type `EQUALS`:

```java
root.getLexeme().getType() == LexemeType.EQUALS
```

The left child of the "=" is represented by a `ParseTreeNode` class with a `Lexeme` of type `VARIABLE`:

```java
root.getLeft().getLexeme().getType() == LexemeType.VARIABLE
```

One can access the actual variable name -- "x" -- like so:

```java
root.getLeft().getLexeme().getValueAsString()
```

Here's how each tree should be structured with respect to the type of lexeme it contains:


* `VARIABLE` nodes should have no children
* `NUMBER` nodes should have no children
* `USER_INPUT` nodes should have no children
* `EQUALS` nodes:
	* left child: a `VARIABLE` node describing the variable being assigned
	* right child: an `OPERATOR`, `VARIABLE`, or `USER_INPUT` node describing the computation, lookup, or prompting needed to get the value of the variable
* `OPERATOR` nodes should have two children that represent the left and right-hand operands. The children of an `OPERATOR` node could be another `OPERATOR` node, a `NUMBER` node, a `VARIABLE` node, or an `USER_INPUT` node.


You are encouraged to look at the two tests in `ParserTest` to see precisely what your parser's `evaluate()` should generate. Notice that the order of the children of `OPERATOR` nodes is not arbitrary: whichever appears first in the input string is treated as the left child.

Here's another example of a PitoScript statement and it's matching parse tree:

```
myVar = (5 * 6) + (4 / (3 + 1));
```

![Parse tree for above example](http://cs.brandeis.edu/~rcmarcus/cs12b/parse3.png)
\

Multi-statement PitoScript trees will be represented as a list of trees. For example:

```
myVar = 6 + 5;
x = myVar * 2;
y = (x * 2) / 5.5;
```
![Parse tree for above example](http://cs.brandeis.edu/~rcmarcus/cs12b/parse4.png)
\ 

Here's a general procedure in pseudo-code to get you thinking about how such a parser could operate. This code assumes that the input program is properly formatted. You may make this assumption as well, but when writing a "real" compiler, you'd want to check the input for correctness and output a sensical error message.

```python
def parse():
    make an empty list of ParseTreeNode called tree_nodes
    while there are tokens remaining:
        variable = lexer.next() # get the variable lexeme
        lexer.next() # skip the equals sign
    
        create an empty list of lexemes called expression
        while the last element of expression is not a ";":
            add l.next() to expression

	    remove the last element from expression (the ";")

        make a new parse tree node called toAdd with LexemeType.EQUALS
        set the left subtree of toAdd to be a tree node with the variable
        set the right subtree of toAdd to eval_expression(expression)
        
        add toAdd to the tree_nodes list
    return tree_nodes

def eval_expression(expression):
    if there is only one thing in the expression:
        just create and return a new parse tree node with that Lexeme
        since it will be a number, a variable, or a user input symbol


    left = None, right = None, operator = None
    if the first lexeme in the expression is a left paren:
        # find the matching end paren
        endIdx = getMatchingParen(expression)

        left = eval_expression on the elements inside of the parens

        if there are no symbols after the end paren:
            return left
        
        right = eval_expression on the elements after the end paren
        
        operator = find the oeprator linking the two
    else:
        # no parens
        left = eval_expression([the first element of expression])
        operator = the second element of the expression
        right = eval_expression([the rest of the expression])

    toR = create a new parse tree node for the operator
    toR.setLeft(left)
    toR.setRight(right)
    return toR
	
```

Notice that PitoScript does **not** follow the traditional order of operations (PEMDAS). Instead, PitoScript evaluates expressions purely right-to-left. In other words, the parse tree for the program `x = 5 * 6 + 1` is this:

![parse tree for right-to-left order](http://cs.brandeis.edu/~rcmarcus/cs12b/parse5.png)
\

For this program, the value of `x` should be `35`, not `31`.



Once you've completed the parser, you should test your code use the tests in `ParserTest.java`. You'll need a working parser before you'll be able to move on to implementing the `Interpreter`.


### Step 3: Implementing `Interpreter` (due April 18th, 10am)

The `Interpreter` class takes in a `List` of `ParseTreeNode`s through its constructor and has a single method you will need to implement called `evaluate`. 

The output of the `evaluate` method should be a `Map<String, Double>` containing the final values of all the variables defined in the program.

For example, when your intrepreter is constructed with the appropiate list of parse tree nodes for this program:

```
x = (5 - 4) + (6 * 4);
y = x * 4;
```

It should return a mapping that looks like:

```javascript
{ "x": 25.0, "y": 100.0 }
```

In the `evaluate` method, you should iterate through the list of `ParseTreeNode`s and, for each statement, store an entry in a *symbol table* (which can just be a `Map`) mapping each variable to it's appropriate value. Future statements can access this same symbol table to get the value of a variable, and you can simply return the symbol table at the end in order to give back all the values of the variables.

Here's some pseudo-code that you can use to guide your implementation:

```python
def evaluate(ptns):
	for ptn in ptns: # for each parse tree node in the list of parse tree nodes
		extract the name of the variable being assigned
		calculate the value of the variable via evalNode(ptn.getRight())

        put an entry into the symbol table mapping this variable to its value

	return the symbol table
```

The `evalNode(ParseTreeNode t)` method might look something like this (again, in pseudo-code):

```python
def evalNode(ptn):
    if it is a user input lexeme, prompt the user and return the value
    if it is a variable, look the variable up and return its value
    if it is a number, return that number

    if it is an operator:
        left_side = call evalNode on the left child
        right_side = call evalNode on the right child

        if ptn's value is "+":
            return left_side + right_side

        if ptn's value is "*":
            return left_side * right_side

        ...

    throw an exception if we don't know how to handle a node of this type...

```

The "big idea" behind the `evaluate` method is to store the variables with their respective values in a symbol table as you interpret the program, and just spit out that same symbol table at the end. The big idea behind the `evalNode` method is to recursively evaluate an expression. Once you finish the interpreter, you should pass all the tests in `InterpreterTest.java`. These tests probably aren't exhaustive, so you might want to create a few more. My code for the interpreter is 64 lines long (without comments). If you go much over that (say, 150 lines), you are probably doing something wrong...

### Step 4: Implementing `Compiler` (due April 18th, 10am)

The `Compiler` class, like the `Interpreter`, takes in a list of `ParseTreeNode`s in its constructor. However, the `Compiler` has a `compile` method which will return a `List` of `VMInstruction` instances. The goal of any compiler is to *transform* one language into another. Here, you'll be transforming PitoScript into a low-level language that closely resembles the actual 0s and 1s your computer executes. Before explaining how this is done, we'll explain the low-level assembly language of the PitoScript VM.

#### The PitoScript VM

The PitoScript virtual machine (or VM, for short), is a very simple virtual machine that has:

* 3 registers: `r0`, `r1`, and `r2`
* 1000 `double`s worth of RAM
* A small, simple instruction set

Like your actual computer, the PitoScript VM stores values in memory at certain locations called *memory addresses*. If you write the value "100" to memory location 6, and then you read from memory location 6, you'll get the value "100" back. You can think of the memory itself as an array, and memory addresses/locations as indexes into that array. Also like your actual computer, the PitoScript VM has three *registers*, called `r0`, `r1`, and `r2`. Registers are special pieces of hardware that can hold a single value, but can also be used in operations.


A PitoScript VM has the following operations:

Arithmetic operations:

* `ADD a, b, c`: takes the sum of the values in register `b` and `c`, and stores the result into register `a`.
* `MUL a, b, c`: takes the product of the values in register `b` and `c`, and stores the result into register `a`.
* `SUB a, b, c`: takes the difference of the values in register `b` and `c`, and stores the result into register `a`.
* `DIV a, b, c`: takes the quoient of the values in register `b` and `c`, and stores the result into register `a`.
* `POW a, b, c`: calculates the value stored in register `b` raised to the power of the value stored in register `c` and stores the result in register `a`.

Interaction operations:

* `PROMPT a`: prompts the user for input and stores the result into register `a`.

* `OUTPUT VAR, a`: notes that the final value for the variable `VAR` will be *stored at memory address* `a` (notice that this is not the *value* of `a`, but the value of the memory at the location given by `a`).

Internal operations:

* `SET a, N`: sets the value of register `a` to the literal value of `N`
* `STORE a, b`: stores the value of register `b` into memory *at the memory address stored in `a`*.
* `LOAD a, b`: loads the value of memory at the address stored in `b` into register `a`.

You can think of registers as local variables (you only get three of them), and RAM as a special storage location that you can access with `STORE` and `LOAD`. Like real assembly code, the PitoScript VM has no if statements, for loops, methods, or classes.


The `STORE` and `LOAD` operations might not do exactly what you'd think. Imagine the machine's RAM as a large array of double values, all initialized to zero:

```javascript
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

If you executed these instructions:

```
SET r0, 2
SET r1, 5.6
STORE r0, r1
```

... then the machine's RAM would look like this:

```javascript
[0.0, 0.0, 5.6, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

If you then executed `LOAD r2, r0`, the value of `r2` would be set to 5.6. You can think of `STORE a, b` as `memory[a] = b`, and the line `LOAD a, b` as `a = memory[b]`.




Here's an example of PitoScript VM assembly language that would execute the PitoScript program `x = 5 * 2;`:

```
SET    r0 5      // sets register r0 to 5
SET    r1 2      // sets register r1 to 2
MUL    r2 r0 r1  // calculates r0 * r1 (5 * 2) and stores the value into r2
SET    r0 0      // sets register r0 to 0
STORE  r0 r2     // stores the value of r2 (10) into memory location 0 (r0)
OUTPUT x  r0     // note that the value of the variable "x" is stored at memory location 0 (r0)
SET    r0 10     // set r0 to something else (just for fun, not needed)
```

These types of assembly languages are often called *triple codes* because many of the instructions take exactly three parameters.

Here's a more involved example that executes the PitoScript program `x = (6 / ?) ^ 2;`:

```
SET    r0 6      // r0 = 6	
SET    r1 0 	 // r1 = 0
STORE  r1 r0     // memory[r1] = r0
PROMPT r0  	     // r0 = user input
SET    r2 0 	 // r2 = 0
LOAD   r1 r2 	 // r1 = memory[r2]
DIV    r0 r1 r0  // r0 = r1 / r0
SET    r1 0 	 // r1 = 0
STORE  r1 r0     // memory[r1] = r0
SET    r0 2 	 // r0 = 2
SET    r2 0 	 // r2 = 0
LOAD   r1 r2 	 // r1 = memory[r2]
POW    r0 r1 r0  // r0 = r1^r0
SET    r1 0 	 // r1 = 0
STORE  r1 r0     // memory[r1] = r0
SET    r0 0 	 // r0 = 0
OUTPUT x r0      // x's memory location is r0
```

This example, and the comments on the right-hand side, show how registers can be thought of as local variables and how memory / RAM can be thought of as an array. Since your compiler will be required to return a list of these instructions, we've modeled each line of PitoScript VM assembly as objects. For example, the line `SET r0 6` would be created as follows:

```java
VMInstruction i = new VMInstruction(VMOp.SET, "r0", "0");
```

... and the line `DIV r0 r1 r0` would be created like this:

```java
VMInstruction i2 = new VMInstruction(VMOp.DIV, "r0", "r1", "r0");
```

The program combining these two lines together could then be created with this:

```java
List<VMInstruction> prgm = new LinkedList<VMInstruction>();
prgm.add(i);
prgm.add(i2);
```

If you'd like, you can see the PitoScript VM assembly for the PitoScript program `x = (5 * 2) + (7 / 3); y = x + (? * 3); z = (x^2) + (8 * (4 + y));` [here](http://pastebin.com/mc6f8QGx).


#### The Compiler

Implementing the actual compiler class involves taking in a list of `ParseTreeNode` objects and converting them to a list of `VMInstruction`s. When executed, these `VMInstruction`s should properly execute the PitoScript program.

One approach to generate these instructions is a strategy called *static allocation*. Assign each variable in the PitoScript program to a particular place in memory. Then, write a method that recursively emits VM code for a `ParseTreeNode` and takes in a memory value called a memory offset. One approach to writing such a method might be:

* If the node is a `NUMBER`, set `r0` to be that number
* If the node is a `USER_INPUT` node, emit a `PROMPT r0` instruction
* If the node is a `VARIABLE`, set `r0` to that variable's memory location and then emit `LOAD r0 r0` (load the value of the variable into `r0`
* If the node is an `OPERATOR`...
    1. Emit the code for the left sub-tree (with the same memory offset)
    1. Save `r0` into the memory offset
    1. Emit the code for the right sub-tree (with the memory offset + 1)
    1. Load the value stored at the memory offset into `r2`
    1. Emit the code to perform the operation, storing the result into `r0`, i.e. `ADD r0 r1 r0`.


The "big idea" here is that each call to the emit method causes the appropriate value to be placed into `r0` by storing the result of the left subtree at the memory offset, then computing the right subtree, then combining the result and storing it in `r0`. The reason the memory offset needs to be incremented when evaluating the right subtree is to make sure the recursive case doesn't overwrite what you stored for the left subtree. Finally, when you emit the code for the `EQUAL` node, use the `OUTPUT` instruction.

Once you finish the compiler, you should pass the appropriate unit tests, and you're done (after cleaning up your code, of course)! If you'd like, see if you can optimize the VM code you created by utilizing your interpreter. For example, the PitoScript program `x = (5 * 4) + ?;` could be optimized to `x = 20 + ?;`.

## Testing

Your code can be tested with a provided set of **non-exhaustive** unit tests. That means that if your code fails the tests, it is definitely wrong. The converse is not true: code that can pass the tests is not necessarily correct code.  **Passing the unit tests is not enough to ensure a good score**. You should test your code significantly more on your own. Do not attempt to hard code, corner-case, or otherwise overfit your solution to the tests. We have provided you a subset of the tests that we will use for grading.


##Style guidelines
Follow stylistic guidelines about removing redundancy, using proper data types, indentation, whitespace, identifier names, and commenting at the beginning of your program, on each method, and on complex sections of code.

## Submission
Your exported Eclipse project should be submitted on LATTE. For late policy check the syllabus.

## Grading

You will be graded on:

  * External Correctness: The output of your program should match exactly what is expected. Programs that do not compile will not receive points for external correctness.
  * Internal Correctness:  Your source code should follow the stylistic guidelines shown in class. Also, remember to include the comment header at the beginning of your program.
  * One-on-one interactive grading: By the end of the day that the assignment is due, please make an appointment with your TA for an interactive 10-15 minute grading session. You will receive an email notifying you of the name of the TA who has been assigned to you for this assignment with further instructions on setting up the appointment. (You will be meeting with a different TA for each assignment). One-on-one interactive grading will help you improve your programming skills and avoid repeating mistakes from one assignment to the next.
